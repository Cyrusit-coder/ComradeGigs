                <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">2. User Eligibility</h4>
                <ul class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Students:</strong> Must be currently enrolled in a recognized university or college in Kenya. You must provide a valid School ID for verification.</li>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mb-3">3. Fees and Payments</h4>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-2">
                    <strong>Service Fee:</strong> ComradeGigs charges a flat <strong>5% service fee</strong> on all completed gigs to cover maintenance and security costs. This is deducted automatically from the Student's payout.
                </p>
                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    <strong>M-Pesa:</strong> All payments are processed via M-Pesa. You agree to provide accurate phone numbers. ComradeGigs is not responsible for funds sent to wrong numbers due to user error.

                        <strong>Off-Platform Payments:</strong> Taking a client/student off ComradeGigs to pay via personal M-Pesa/Cash to avoid fees is strictly prohibited. Doing so waives all fraud protection and will result in an immediate account ban.

                <ul class="text-secondary mb-4">

                <p class="text-secondary mb-4">
                    We reserve the right to verify your identity using the School ID provided. Falsifying documents is a criminal offense and will be reported to relevant authorities.
